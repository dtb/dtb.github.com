Joel Beukelman puts into words much better than I've been able to why I prefer Android.
On iOS, I always felt constrained by my inability to freely move between apps. Android's
navigation isn't perfect (I seem to have more problems with it then he does), but together
with the up concept and the app-switcher menu, I find the Android pattern allows me to
get things done faster and more seamlessly than with iOS.
