		<h1>David Thomas Bernal</h1>
		<p>
			I am a web developer living in New York City. I like programming, music, and minimalism.
		</p>
		<h2>Articles</h2>
		<p>
			Every now and then, I write an article. Here are the most-recent five:
		</p>
		<ul id="posts">
			{% for post in site.posts limit:6 %}
                {% unless post.draft %}
                <li>
                    <span class="date">{{ post.date | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</span>
                    <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
                </li>
                {% endunless %}
			{% endfor %}
		</ul>
		<p id="allposts">
			<a href="archive.html">all articles</a>
		</p>
		<h2>At work</h2>
		<p>
			I'm currently working at <a href="http://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a>,	trying to make it
			awesome and fun and easy (all at the same time) to buy things on Etsy.
		</p>
		<h2 id="ontheside">On the side</h2>
		<p>
			I've been trying to come up with a way to draw <a href="/canvas/one.html">beautiful</a> <a href="/canvas/two.html">fractal trees</a> that <a href="/canvas/three.html">sway in a gentle breeze</a>. 
			As it turns out, this is <a href="/canvas/three.1.html">actually</a> <a href="/canvas/three.2.html">pretty</a> <a href="/canvas/three.3.html">frustrating</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I'm not programming, I listen to music and play Starcraft II.
